## Test environments
* local OS X install, R-3.1.2 and R-3.2.0 alpha
* win-builder, R-devel and R-3.1.3

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.   The only NOTEs are references to
my status as a Maintainer

## Vignettes
Can you please confirm that CRAN recognizes three
vignettes for this package?  I have had some difficulty getting pre-built vignettes to appear in
the index using knitr, so I am trying R.rsp for the first time.
